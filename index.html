        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The goal of this site is to help librarians (coders and non-coders alike) quickly and easily make their web presences stronger by tapping into the wonderful world of APIs. There's a staggering amount of useful data offered to the world through APIs - whether it be from Springshare, OCLC, Twitter, even weather services (and many, many more). With some code you can pull, manipulate, and display useful data for your users.</p>

        <p>This site is geared towards librarians who aren't web developers but who would like to enhance their LibGuides or library websites. If you are a coder, then you can perhaps skip over some of the documentation and copy the code right away.</p>

        <p>This is a project in ongoing development. I hope to continually add new implementations. If you have used an API and would like to share your code on this site... great! Let me know.</p>
